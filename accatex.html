                Sales management platforms are beneficial, however, users usually encounter some 
                challenges including: <br>
                1.	Overly complex user interface. Users often find SaaS interfaces to be complicated, 
                and as such, their range of engagement on such platforms are limited. <br>
                2.	Lack of real-time insight. This is a major challenge that users often encounter, as 
                its misinformation directly influences and affects their decision-making, thus putting 
                them at a disadvantage. <br>
                3.	Business owners (users) often experience difficulty and end up making errors when 
                attempting to keep track of their inventories and invoices manually. <br>
